# Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Concrete Classes

## Interface
An interface is a public contract that contains plans for implementation. When a class inherits an interface it must implement the properties, functions, ... defined in the interface it implements.

```csharp
//Example

```

### Benefits
- Future Proofs Code
- Interface Implementation Errors found at Build Time
-
